# APCSP_InteriorDesign
Created an Interior Kitchen Design Application in JavaScript and HTML.

The files in the Interior Kitchen folder contain everything you need to run your app:

* `applab/applab.css` - This file contains some default CSS styling.

* `index.html` - This is the html file that contains all the buttons, text inputs, and other controls for your app. Go here to add additional controls to your app. Run this file to be able to load the application on a computer browser

* `style.css` - This file defines the custom styling for each control in your
  app that you specified to change the colors, positions, dimensions, and other properties of your app's controls.

* `code.js` - This file has all the code you wrote for your app. Go here to add
  new behavior to your app.

* `assets` - This is a directory with all the asset files (pictures and sounds)
  that was uploaded.
